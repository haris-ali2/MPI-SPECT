    abstract = {At present, the choice of noninvasive testing for a diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is ambiguous, but nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is predominantly used for this purpose. However, to date, prospective head-to-head studies are lacking regarding the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities. Furthermore, the combination of anatomical and functional assessments configuring a hybrid approach may yield improved accuracy.To establish the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA, SPECT, and PET and explore the incremental value of hybrid imaging compared with fractional flow reserve.A prospective clinical study involving 208 patients with suspected CAD who underwent CCTA, technetium 99m/tetrofosmin–labeled SPECT, and [15O]H2O PET with examination of all coronary arteries by fractional flow reserve was performed from January 23, 2012, to October 25, 2014. Scans were interpreted by core laboratories on an intention-to-diagnose basis. Hybrid images were generated in case of abnormal noninvasive anatomical or functional test results. Hemodynamically significant stenosis in at least 1 coronary artery as indicated by a fractional flow reserve of 0.80 or less and relative diagnostic accuracy of SPECT, PET, and CCTA in detecting hemodynamically significant CAD.Of the 208 patients in the study (76 women and 132 men; mean [SD] age, 58 [9] years), 92 (44.2\%) had significant CAD (fractional flow reserve ≤0.80). Sensitivity was 90\% (95\% CI, 82\%-95\%) for CCTA, 57\% (95\% CI, 46\%-67\%) for SPECT, and 87\% (95\% CI, 78\%-93\%) for PET, whereas specificity was 60\% (95\% CI, 51\%-69\%) for CCTA, 94\% (95\% CI, 88\%-98\%) for SPECT, and 84\% (95\% CI, 75\%-89\%) for PET. Single-photon emission tomography was found to be noninferior to PET in terms of specificity (P \&lt; .001) but not in terms of sensitivity (P \&gt; .99) using the predefined absolute margin of 10\%. Diagnostic accuracy was highest for PET (85\%; 95\% CI, 80\%-90\%) compared with that of CCTA (74\%; 95\% CI, 67\%-79\%; P = .003) and SPECT (77\%; 95\% CI, 71\%-83\%; P = .02). Diagnostic accuracy was not enhanced by either hybrid SPECT and CCTA (76\%; 95\% CI, 70\%-82\%; P = .75) or by PET and CCTA (84\%; 95\% CI, 79\%-89\%; P = .82), but resulted in an increase in specificity (P = .004) at the cost of a decrease in sensitivity (P = .001).This controlled clinical head-to-head comparative study revealed PET to exhibit the highest accuracy for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, a combined anatomical and functional assessment does not add incremental diagnostic value but guides clinical decision-making in an unsalutary fashion.},

Our current suite of software applications has been designed to be platform– and operating system–independent, and every algorithm is based on the same 3-dimensional sampling scheme for the myocardium. The widespread acceptance of quantitative software by the nuclear cardiology community (QGS alone is used at over 20,000 locations) has provided the opportunity for extensive validation of quantitative measurements of myocardial perfusion and function, in our opinion, helping to make nuclear cardiology the most accurate and reproducible modality available for the assessment of the human heart.}

The model incorporates appearance and shape information into a ‘soft-to-hard’ probabilistic constraint, and utilises spatiotemporal regularisation via a maximum a posteriori framework. This constraint force allows more flexibility than the rigid forces of shape constraint-only schemes, as well as other state of the art joint shape and appearance constraints. The combined model can hypothesise defective LV borders based on prior knowledge. The authors present comparative results to illustrate the improvement gain. A brief defect detection example is finally presented as an application of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Precise definition of the mitral valve plane (VP) during segmentation of the left ventricle for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) quantification often requires manual adjustment, which affects the quantification of perfusion. We developed a machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) for automatic VP placement. Methods: A total of 392 consecutive patients undergoing (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin stress (5 min; mean ± SD, 350 ± 54 MBq) and rest (5 min; 1,024 ± 153 MBq) fast SPECT MPI attenuation corrected (AC) by CT and same-day coronary CT angiography were studied; included in the 392 patients were 48 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography and had no known coronary artery disease. The left ventricle was segmented with standard clinical software (quantitative perfusion SPECT) by 2 experts, adjusting the VP if needed. Two-class SVM models were computed from the expert placements with 10-fold cross validation to separate the patients used for training and those used for validation. SVM probability estimates were used to compute the best VP position. Automatic VP localizations on AC and non-AC images were compared with expert placement on coronary CT angiography. Stress and rest total perfusion deficits and detection of per-vessel obstructive stenosis by invasive coronary angiography were also compared. Results: Bland-Altman 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for VP localization by SVM and experts for AC stress images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -5 to 7 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -7 to 10 mm) were narrower than interexpert 95{\%} CIs for AC stress images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -8 to 8 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -10 to 10 mm) (P {\textless} 0.01). Bland-Altman 95{\%} CIs for VP localization by SVM and experts for non-AC stress images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -4 to 6 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, 2; 95{\%} CI, -7 to 10 mm) were similar to interexpert 95{\%} CIs for non-AC stress images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -6 to 5 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, -1; 95{\%} CI, -9 to 7 mm) (P was not significant [NS]). For regional detection of obstructive stenosis, ischemic total perfusion deficit areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 2 experts (AUC, 0.79 [95{\%} CI, 0.7-0.87]; AUC, 0.81 [95{\%} CI, 0.73-0.89]) and the SVM (0.82 [0.74-0.9]) for AC data were the same (P = NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.63 [0.53-0.73]) (P {\textless} 0.01). Similarly, for non-AC data, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the experts (AUC, 0.77 [95{\%} CI, 0.69-0.89]; AUC, 0.8 [95{\%} CI, 0.72-0.88]) and the SVM (0.79 [0.71-0.87]) were the same (P = NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.65 [0.56-0.75]) (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: Machine learning with SVM allows automatic and accurate VP localization, decreasing user dependence in SPECT MPI quantification.},

abstract = {Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) is the golden standard in detecting and assessing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Due to its role and incidence in diagnostics, automated and semi-automated solutions are available aiding diagnoses based on the perfusion and function of the left ventricle. Evaluation with Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) cameras often takes > 30 minutes and due to patient cardinality, shortened acquisition produces images with lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), challenging automated solutions. Here a fully automated method is presented, solving the left ventricle (LV) segmentation problem. The method is a 3D U-Net-based, self-supervised learning (SSL) approach, with a rich augmentation pipeline. A brief study is presented where the proposed algorithm is compared to the current state-of-the-art solution in Machine Learning (ML), with the evaluation of various segmentation metrics of the left ventricular muscle tissue. The proposed method showed an effective 89 \% precision on the segmentation task of MPI studies on both simulated and real datasets. In conclusion, the technique can aid the evaluation of MPI studies in clinical environments by automating the segmentation of studies with a high success rate.},

abstract = {Transformer, the model of choice for natural language processing, has drawn scant attention from the medical imaging community. Given the ability to exploit long-term dependencies, transformers are promising to help atypical convolutional neural networks to learn more contextualized visual representations. However, most of recently proposed transformer-based segmentation approaches simply treated transformers as assisted modules to help encode global context into convolutional representations. To address this issue, we introduce nnFormer (i.e., not-another transFormer), a 3D transformer for volumetric medical image segmentation. nnFormer not only exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and self-attention operations, but also introduces local and global volume-based self-attention mechanism to learn volume representations. Moreover, nnFormer proposes to use skip attention to replace the traditional concatenation/summation operations in skip connections in U-Net like architecture. Experiments show that nnFormer significantly outperforms previous transformer-based counterparts by large margins on three public datasets. Compared to nnUNet, the most widely recognized convnet-based 3D medical segmentation model, nnFormer produces significantly lower HD95 and is much more computationally efficient. Furthermore, we show that nnFormer and nnUNet are highly complementary to each other in model ensembling. Codes and models of nnFormer are available at <uri>https://git.io/JSf3i</uri>.},

abstract = {Purpose : The authors develop the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for multimodality imaging research. Methods: Highly detailed whole-body anatomies for the adult male and female were defined in the XCAT using nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and subdivision surfaces based on segmentation of the Visible Male and Female anatomical datasets from the National Library of Medicine as well as patient datasets. Using the flexibility of these surfaces, the Visible Human anatomies were transformed to match body measurements and organ volumes for a 50th percentile (height and weight) male and female. The desired body measurements for the models were obtained using thePEOPLESIZE program that contains anthropometric dimensions categorized from 1st to the 99th percentile for US adults. The desired organ volumes were determined from ICRP Publication 89 [ICRP, “Basic anatomical and physiological data for use in radiological protection: reference values,” ICRP Publication 89 (International Commission on Radiological Protection, New York, NY, 2002)]. The male and female anatomies serve as standard templates upon which anatomical variations may be modeled in the XCAT through user-defined parameters. Parametrized models for the cardiac and respiratory motions were also incorporated into the XCAT based on high-resolution cardiac- and respiratory-gated multislice CT data. To demonstrate the usefulness of the phantom, the authors show example simulation studies in PET, SPECT, and CT using publicly available simulation packages. Results: As demonstrated in the pilot studies, the 4D XCAT (which includes thousands of anatomical structures) can produce realistic imaging data when combined with accurate models of the imaging process. With the flexibility of the NURBS surface primitives, any number of different anatomies, cardiac or respiratory motions or patterns, and spatial resolutions can be simulated to perform imaging research. Conclusions: With the ability to produce realistic, predictive 3D and 4D imaging data from populations of normal and abnormal patients under various imaging parameters, the authors conclude that the XCAT provides an important tool in imaging research to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques. In the field of x-ray CT, the phantom may also provide the necessary foundation with which to optimize clinical CT applications in terms of image quality versus radiation dose, an area of research that is becoming more significant with the growing use of CT.},
