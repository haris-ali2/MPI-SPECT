    abstract = {At present, the choice of noninvasive testing for a diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is ambiguous, but nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is predominantly used for this purpose. However, to date, prospective head-to-head studies are lacking regarding the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities. Furthermore, the combination of anatomical and functional assessments configuring a hybrid approach may yield improved accuracy.To establish the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA, SPECT, and PET and explore the incremental value of hybrid imaging compared with fractional flow reserve.A prospective clinical study involving 208 patients with suspected CAD who underwent CCTA, technetium 99m/tetrofosmin–labeled SPECT, and [15O]H2O PET with examination of all coronary arteries by fractional flow reserve was performed from January 23, 2012, to October 25, 2014. Scans were interpreted by core laboratories on an intention-to-diagnose basis. Hybrid images were generated in case of abnormal noninvasive anatomical or functional test results. Hemodynamically significant stenosis in at least 1 coronary artery as indicated by a fractional flow reserve of 0.80 or less and relative diagnostic accuracy of SPECT, PET, and CCTA in detecting hemodynamically significant CAD.Of the 208 patients in the study (76 women and 132 men; mean [SD] age, 58 [9] years), 92 (44.2\%) had significant CAD (fractional flow reserve ≤0.80). Sensitivity was 90\% (95\% CI, 82\%-95\%) for CCTA, 57\% (95\% CI, 46\%-67\%) for SPECT, and 87\% (95\% CI, 78\%-93\%) for PET, whereas specificity was 60\% (95\% CI, 51\%-69\%) for CCTA, 94\% (95\% CI, 88\%-98\%) for SPECT, and 84\% (95\% CI, 75\%-89\%) for PET. Single-photon emission tomography was found to be noninferior to PET in terms of specificity (P \&lt; .001) but not in terms of sensitivity (P \&gt; .99) using the predefined absolute margin of 10\%. Diagnostic accuracy was highest for PET (85\%; 95\% CI, 80\%-90\%) compared with that of CCTA (74\%; 95\% CI, 67\%-79\%; P = .003) and SPECT (77\%; 95\% CI, 71\%-83\%; P = .02). Diagnostic accuracy was not enhanced by either hybrid SPECT and CCTA (76\%; 95\% CI, 70\%-82\%; P = .75) or by PET and CCTA (84\%; 95\% CI, 79\%-89\%; P = .82), but resulted in an increase in specificity (P = .004) at the cost of a decrease in sensitivity (P = .001).This controlled clinical head-to-head comparative study revealed PET to exhibit the highest accuracy for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, a combined anatomical and functional assessment does not add incremental diagnostic value but guides clinical decision-making in an unsalutary fashion.},

Our current suite of software applications has been designed to be platform– and operating system–independent, and every algorithm is based on the same 3-dimensional sampling scheme for the myocardium. The widespread acceptance of quantitative software by the nuclear cardiology community (QGS alone is used at over 20,000 locations) has provided the opportunity for extensive validation of quantitative measurements of myocardial perfusion and function, in our opinion, helping to make nuclear cardiology the most accurate and reproducible modality available for the assessment of the human heart.}

abstract = {The authors propose a novel spatiotemporal constraint based on shape and appearance and combine it with a level-set deformable model for left ventricle (LV) segmentation in four-dimensional gated cardiac SPECT, particularly in the presence of perfusion defects. The model incorporates appearance and shape information into a ‘soft-to-hard’ probabilistic constraint, and utilises spatiotemporal regularisation via a maximum a posteriori framework. This constraint force allows more flexibility than the rigid forces of shape constraint-only schemes, as well as other state of the art joint shape and appearance constraints. The combined model can hypothesise defective LV borders based on prior knowledge. The authors present comparative results to illustrate the improvement gain. A brief defect detection example is finally presented as an application of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Precise definition of the mitral valve plane (VP) during segmentation of the left ventricle for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) quantification often requires manual adjustment, which affects the quantification of perfusion. We developed a machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) for automatic VP placement. Methods: A total of 392 consecutive patients undergoing (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin stress (5 min; mean ± SD, 350 ± 54 MBq) and rest (5 min; 1,024 ± 153 MBq) fast SPECT MPI attenuation corrected (AC) by CT and same-day coronary CT angiography were studied; included in the 392 patients were 48 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography and had no known coronary artery disease. The left ventricle was segmented with standard clinical software (quantitative perfusion SPECT) by 2 experts, adjusting the VP if needed. Two-class SVM models were computed from the expert placements with 10-fold cross validation to separate the patients used for training and those used for validation. SVM probability estimates were used to compute the best VP position. Automatic VP localizations on AC and non-AC images were compared with expert placement on coronary CT angiography. Stress and rest total perfusion deficits and detection of per-vessel obstructive stenosis by invasive coronary angiography were also compared. Results: Bland-Altman 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for VP localization by SVM and experts for AC stress images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -5 to 7 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -7 to 10 mm) were narrower than interexpert 95{\%} CIs for AC stress images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -8 to 8 mm) and AC rest images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -10 to 10 mm) (P {\textless} 0.01). Bland-Altman 95{\%} CIs for VP localization by SVM and experts for non-AC stress images (bias, 1; 95{\%} CI, -4 to 6 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, 2; 95{\%} CI, -7 to 10 mm) were similar to interexpert 95{\%} CIs for non-AC stress images (bias, 0; 95{\%} CI, -6 to 5 mm) and non-AC rest images (bias, -1; 95{\%} CI, -9 to 7 mm) (P was not significant [NS]). For regional detection of obstructive stenosis, ischemic total perfusion deficit areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 2 experts (AUC, 0.79 [95{\%} CI, 0.7-0.87]; AUC, 0.81 [95{\%} CI, 0.73-0.89]) and the SVM (0.82 [0.74-0.9]) for AC data were the same (P = NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.63 [0.53-0.73]) (P {\textless} 0.01). Similarly, for non-AC data, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the experts (AUC, 0.77 [95{\%} CI, 0.69-0.89]; AUC, 0.8 [95{\%} CI, 0.72-0.88]) and the SVM (0.79 [0.71-0.87]) were the same (P = NS) and were higher than those for the unadjusted VP (0.65 [0.56-0.75]) (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: Machine learning with SVM allows automatic and accurate VP localization, decreasing user dependence in SPECT MPI quantification.},
